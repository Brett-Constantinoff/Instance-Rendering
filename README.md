# Instance Rendering

This project is a showcase of how powerful instance rendering is compared to standard rendering.

Without using instancing, you can render about 50,000 cubes before signficant performace losses occur.

Using instancing, you can render the about 700,000 cubes before performance begins to fall behind, and even
then its nothing crazy.
